<p>Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/11/12openjdk.html">ceases</a> its development of Java for Mac and passes its key modules to Open JDK. Java 6 is to be supported on Snow Leopard and upcoming releases of Mac OS X by Apple, Java 7 is to be delivered by Oracle.</p>
<p>I think that Oracle will just buy Apple's Java developers. While this decision can potentially help Java because delays with Apple shipping of Java are <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1856">wideknown</a>, I doubt Oracle will drive innovation and make slick, high-performant and integrated Java for Mac OS X.</p>
