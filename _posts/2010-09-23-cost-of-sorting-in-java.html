<p>What happens when you call <code>Collections.sort(myList)</code>, how do you think? It is obvious, that efficient sorting algorithm will be applied, isn't it? Not so easy.</p>
<p>First, <code>list.toArray()</code> method is called. Depending on which one of the two most common <code>List</code> implementations you use: <code>ArrayList</code> or <code>LinkedList</code>, it costs array creation and either efficient <code>System.arraycopy()</code> call in the case of <code>ArrayList</code> or list iteration and one-by-one element copying in the case of <code>LinkedList</code>.</p>
<p>Next, the array will be sorted using <code>Arrays.sort(Object[])</code> method. Guess, what happens there. Another array of the same size is created, elements are copied into it (pretty efficiently though), and mergesort is performed on it recursively.</p>
<p>In the end, elements are copied from the sorted array into initial <code>List</code> one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Grand total cost</strong> is 2 array creations and sorting cost equal to <code>O(n*log(n))</code>. Don't forget about recursive calls.</p>
<p>Now suppose, that system under load has to perform dozens of such sorts per second on an array of size about 20000. This becomes a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The solution is easy: write custom sorting procedure and perform quicksort on your <code>ArrayList</code> or consider to use another container, e.g. <code>SortedSet</code>. <code>Arrays.sort()</code> for arrays of primitive types doesn't suffer of redundant array creation. It merely uses quicksort.</p>
<p>For the future: know you libs.<br />
Best of luck!</p>
